TIPS

-It is always beneficial to have a shield set up (a shield is set up by choosing the elemental spell that opposes the chosen wizard's element).
	-A shield will disappear to block all damage coming from an opposing element.
	-A shield will disappear to prevent a killing blow.
	-Shields can be used to test Faeries or any demon whose element is unknown.

-In level 2-4 (after the first night), demons have 4 HP, so you need to hit them
	once before you can finish them off with the opposing elemental wizard
	without taking a critical hit.

-Wizards at 1 HP can be traversed without taking damage by choosing them and then
	setting up a shield.
