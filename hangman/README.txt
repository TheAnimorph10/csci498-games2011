Project 9

This is my working directory for my implementation of Hangman.  To play, merely start up the VM Emulator, and click run.
The on screen instructions will prompt you to input a number between 0-9 inclusive and then to begin guessing letters.
The program will echo whatever key you input and then move on, showing what letters you have gotten correct and then allow you
to input your next guess until either you have run out of guesses (7) or you have gotten the word correct.
